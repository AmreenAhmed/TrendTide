# TrendTide
 Trend-Driven Social Media Platform Prototype

Hi! I’m **Amreen Ahmed**, and TrendTide is my take on what a modern social platform *should* look like — one that goes beyond likes and scrolling,conversations.

## 👥 Why I Built This

Social platforms today focus too much on **algorithms and passive scrolling** where users attract alot of products and shop from the post Interaction. I wanted to flip that — to design a space that supports:
- Deep conversations
- Real-time updates
- Community-driven interaction
- Reward System which offers discounts for Users who Shop Through Social Media

**User Research Highlights:**
- 75% prefer discussion over scrolling
- 65% want real-time, trend-based features
- Most dislike lack of control, algorithmic feeds, and shallow content
- alot of Users are Shopping from Social Media through Posts,Reels etc, where don't have any discounts
