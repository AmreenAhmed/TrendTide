# TrendTide
 Trend-Driven Social Media Platform Prototype
# 🚀 TrendTide – Where Trends Spark Conversations

Hi! I’m **Amreen Ahmed**, and TrendTide is my take on what a modern social platform *should* look like — one that goes beyond likes and scrolling, and brings back actual **conversations**.

---

## 🌟 What is TrendTide?

TrendTide is a **trend-driven social media prototype** inspired by Reddit, built to encourage meaningful, real-time discussions. Think of it as a place where viral topics meet thoughtful threads — combining the **dynamism of social trends** with the **depth of threaded conversations**.

📍 Designed with users in mind  
🛠️ Built — UX, frontend, and user research

## 👥 Why I Built This

Social platforms today focus too much on **algorithms and passive scrolling**. I wanted to flip that — to design a space that supports:
- Deep conversations
- Real-time updates
- Community-driven interaction

I ran a short **user research survey** and here’s what I learned:
- 75% prefer discussion over scrolling
- 65% want real-time, trend-based features
- Most dislike lack of control, algorithmic feeds, and shallow content
